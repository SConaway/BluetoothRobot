# RobotControl
An Arduino-based Bluetooth Robot


Based on:
*  Arduino UNO R3
*  L298N motor driver
*  HC-06 Bluetooth UART Module

When assembled, this becomes a remote-controlled robot.

I based it off of https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M2Z9ZTV/ with my own custom shield. THe L298N has the same pins, just the HC-06 now uses ReceiveOnlySoftwareSerial on pin A2
